Mindsweeper v5.0, Utsav 2016
----------------------------

Mindsweeper is the official treasure hunt for Utsav.

The web-application is built using Flask and it's extensions (flask-login, flask-seasurf); the back-end of the application (storing user and level data) is implemented using redis (py-redis SDK). As of now, the application is hosted on a free-tier instance of Google Compute Engine. For handling concurrency, the application runs on top of gunicorn. The front-end of the application is implemented HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. The HTML pages are rendered using the jinja2 templating engine.

To start the server in production, run startup.sh (change the number of workers for gunicorn accordingly). If you have to run a single instance, run server.py with the debug option set to True for local development/testing.

Note: The CSS was written in a hurry, so please feel free to refactor it.
